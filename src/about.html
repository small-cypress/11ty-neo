<p>Hi!</p>

<p>likes: big dogs & force-free dog training, planted fish tanks, letterpress printing, southern history, the civil war, good faith interactions, Contrapoints</p>

<p>dislikes: intellectually lazy takes, bad faith interactions, AI art stans, living with an immunodeficiency</p>

<p>aspires: to be a dahlia gardener and re-learn how to sail small boats!</p>


<p>I think people can and will change their minds with good faith, 1:1 interactions if you're not an asshole. That's my conspiracy theory. Sober from alcohol, trying to learn how to interface with the internet in ways that won't break my brain. </p>
