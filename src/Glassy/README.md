## Difference between Dynamic version and Static version

The dynamic version works like a template, with multiple "pages" in a single html file. This decreases the number of files to edit and ensures that only one file needs to be edited to make changes to the template.

The static version is like a regular static website, where each page has its own html file.

Both versions have the same style and functionalities. Within each version are instructions for editing the content.
