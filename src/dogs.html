                    I have always really loved dogs. I was the kid with the dog breed book marking out every kind of dog I would have when I was an adult. I have mostly rescued, but I currently have a pair of rare breed dogs closely related to German Shepherds. They are bigger and lazier but still require a lot of training and consistency.

                   <p><p>My last rescue became reactive after an aversive board and train experience and was rehomed to me after a bite. She became a really wonderful dog, and when I was preparing for my first shepherd I learned about force-free training.

                   <p><p> My bigger dog is 120 lbs and was very reactive since puppyhood, as is half his litter. I learned that it's not <i>just</i> how you raise dogs - genetics are real and not always predictable. He is miles better and happier and we are all less stressed now. Along the way I have gathered a lot of resources I might as well organize here :)

<p><a href="https://www.fenzidogsportsacademy.com/">Fenzi Dog Sports Academy</a> | I did the nosework and agility into classes in the pandemic. It was affordable and the instructors were good. It was also fun to have a dog in a class with a friend in another state.<p>
